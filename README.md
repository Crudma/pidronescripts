This is a collection of helpful scripts for Ardupilot based vehicles. 

The companion computer was originally a Pi on ArduCopter, hence the repo name. 
This has expanded into Jetson Nano support on a rover. 

Vehicle specific scripts are shown under dk, where you can see drone and rover based python dronekit scripts.
